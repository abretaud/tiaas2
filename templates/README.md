# Customizing TIaaS templates

This directory exposes some template "snippets" that admins can use to easily
alter text content on the site. This allows you to run a TIaaS website that
reflects the identity of your Galaxy service.

If you find some text in the website you'd like to edit, try grepping this
directory to see if a template holds the text! The templates are very concise
and are broken into parts of a page, rather than entire pages, to make the
content more editable.

If you see text content that you would like to edit which is not exposed here,
please make an issue on GitHub to request this.
