The Galaxy Community is dedicated to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

This Code of Conduct outlines the behaviours deemed acceptable and unacceptable to the global Galaxy community and applies to all public Galaxy spaces, including but not limited to events, GitHub, Gitter, Matrix, Slack, Twitter and the Galaxy mailing lists, both online and off.

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Galaxy CoC Committee. Some Galaxy Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

This project adheres to the [Galaxy Project Code of Conduct](https://galaxyproject.org/community/coc/) please see that link for all relevant information.
